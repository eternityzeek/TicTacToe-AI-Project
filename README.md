This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game built using `tkinter` for the graphical user interface. The project includes two modes:  
𝟏. 𝐇𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐧 𝐯𝐬 𝐀𝐈:   Play against a computer opponent powered by the minimax algorithm.  
𝟐. 𝐀𝐈 𝐯𝐬 𝐀𝐈: Watch two AIs compete in real-time to determine the winner.

𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬  
𝐓𝐰𝐨 𝐆𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬: Human vs AI and AI vs AI.  
𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐱 𝐀𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦: AI makes optimal moves, ensuring a challenging experience.  
𝐆𝐔𝐈 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐓𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫: Interactive user interface for easy gameplay.  
𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Current game state is printed in the console after each move for easy tracking.  

𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐬  
- Python 3.x  
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
